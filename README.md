# What is EPB repo?
EPB or Epic Pebble Battle is the name of the game website that I am working on. 
The goal of the website is to teach me programming, by experimenting with the implementation of different gamemodes, settings, features.
## What is the game?
The game is simple. There are a number of stones that players can take away from and a number of stones that we can take away.
The goal of the game is to force the other player into taking the last rock. Currently, the game features two players.
